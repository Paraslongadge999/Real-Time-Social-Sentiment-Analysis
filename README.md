# 🌍 Real-Time Social Sentiment Dashboard  
### Turning raw social comments into actionable insights — instantly.

---

## ⭐ Project Overview  
In today’s world, brands, creators, and businesses live in the middle of constant public feedback. Comments flow in every second across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram — but very few tools help you *understand* what people are saying in real time.

This project was born from a simple question:

> **“What if we could see public sentiment shift the moment a comment is posted?”**

The result is a beautiful, real-time sentiment analysis dashboard built with **Streamlit**, **Python**, **NLP**, and **interactive data visualization**.  
It analyzes social comments, classifies sentiment, visualizes trends, and even simulates live comment streams for demo purposes.

A perfect blend of **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and **UI design** — packaged as a recruiter-friendly portfolio project.

## 🎯 What This Dashboard Does  
This dashboard transforms a raw CSV dataset of social comments into a full analytic experience:

### ✔ Real-time sentiment scoring (VADER NLP)  
### ✔ KPI cards (Positive %, Neutral %, Negative %, total comments)  
### ✔ Smart filtering (platforms, sentiment type, time)  
### ✔ Advanced sentiment trend charts (Plotly)  
### ✔ Platform-wise insights (where negativity spikes, where positivity grows)  
### ✔ Clean preprocessing pipeline (normalization, cleaning, tokenization)  
### ✔ Interactive drilldown table  
### ✔ Professional simulated live comment streaming mode  

This is not just a visualization —  
**It’s a functional product that mimics how a real SaaS sentiment tool works.**

## 🔥 Why I Built This  
Recruiters often ask:  
**“Can you build something end-to-end?”**

I wanted a project that shows exactly that.

From **data cleaning** → **NLP** → **back-end logic** → **front-end dashboard** → **deployment**,  
this project demonstrates full-stack data skills with real-time components.

It also tells a story:

- How sentiment fluctuates over time  
- How different platforms behave  
- What triggers positive or negative reactions  
- How an analyst or marketer could use this in real life  

This is the kind of dashboard that product teams actually use — and now it lives in my portfolio.
